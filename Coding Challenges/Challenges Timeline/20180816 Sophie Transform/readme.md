### Sophie transform


*Definition*: I define the *sophie transform* as the operation defined on integers consisting in replacing each digit by its square, in place. For instance `sophie(408) = 16064`. Also remember that a _square_ is any integer which is the square of another integer. For instance 16 and 25 are squares.

I will give 5 points to the first person to post a number greater than 1000 that is not a multiple of 10 (otherwise it's too easy), whose sophie transform is a square.


### Solution

Sophie herself gave the a solution: 1105. It's transform is 11025, which is the square of 105.
