### Gravitational Slingshot

The challenge this week is a client side challenge ðŸŽ‰

The task is to demonstrate the concept of [gravitational slingshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist).

Make a simple web page which when displayed shows moving objects (on a canvas) bound by gravitation and which show thegravitational slingshot effect in action. Imagine yourself being a science teacher and preparing a view for your students to illustrate the effect ðŸ™‚ 

You might want to refresh your mind on [Newton's second law](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/forces-newtons-laws/newtons-laws-of-motion/a/what-is-newtons-second-law)

... and the way [Gravitation works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity#Newton's_theory_of_gravitation). 

Scoring: *10* points for each submission and *3* additonal points for the best one (we will vote). 

Good luck ðŸ™‚

### ps:

The story behind this challenge is that when I was a kid, I saw on TV a documentary about the [Galileo probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(spacecraft)) which used slingshots around Venus and the Earth to reach destination. At the time my understanding of gravitation (for having been born and raised at the surface of the Earth), was limited to uniform gravitational fields and I didn't want to believe slingshots were actually real. So I wrote a piece of code on my computer, essentially this week challenge, until I managed to observe it myself on the screen and convinced myself it was, indeed, a consequence of Newton's second law and the law of gravitation ðŸ™‚
