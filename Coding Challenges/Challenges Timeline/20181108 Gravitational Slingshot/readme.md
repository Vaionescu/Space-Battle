### Gravitational Slingshot

The challenge this week is a client side challenge ðŸŽ‰

The task is to demonstrate the concept of [gravitational slingshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist).

Make a simple web page which when displayed shows moving objects (on a canvas) bound by gravitation and which show thegravitational slingshot effect in action. Imagine yourself being a science teacher and preparing a view for your students to illustrate the effect ðŸ™‚ 

You might want to refresh your mind on [Newton's second law](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/forces-newtons-laws/newtons-laws-of-motion/a/what-is-newtons-second-law)

... and the way [Gravitation works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity#Newton's_theory_of_gravitation). 

Scoring: *10* points for each submission and *3* additonal points for the best one (we will vote). 

Good luck ðŸ™‚
