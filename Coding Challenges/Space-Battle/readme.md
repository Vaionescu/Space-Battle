## Space Battle

The following describes the documents that are going to introduce you to the game and teach you how to play.

- **01-Introduction to Space Battle**: High level description of the game.

- **02-Game URLs (quick look)**: quick look up of all the end points.

- **03-Game API.md**: Read this if you intend to play, it contains everything you need to drive your fleet, either manually from the command line or through a programmatic client (written in the language of your choice since the interface is just HTTP).

- **04-Game Rules**: More details about the game.

The game is the result of two things that were brought together:

- Challenge 20180913 (Travelling Optimization on Map of Energy Points, see Challenges Timeline for details), and 
- Pascal's love for [Eve Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online).
