## Space Battle

**Space Battle** is a game born out of (move exactly evolved from) the weekly coding challenges of Summer 2018. 

The main idea of the game is simple: you control a space fleet and your objective is to destroy enemy space ships before they destroy yours.

The game mechanics allow for complex game strategies and game styles, allowing you to showcase your skills as fleet commander.

The most striking aspect of this game, relatively to other games you may have played, is that it comes without a graphical user interface. It only comes with an HTTP interface. You could play on the command line, as all the actions (from generating energy, to building or moving your ships, to shooting at enemies) are simple curl+url commands. Obviously, you may also want, as it's been done with challenges of previous weeks that came with an HTTP interface, just build a small client, in the programming language of your choice, and let it play for you.

In this sense it's a game made for developers. 


## Game mechanics

The game has three kind of objects: your **Capital Ships**, **Battle Cruisers** and **Energy Carriers**.

We carry on to this game the same scheduling that has shown to be great for previous weekly challenges: a new game starts at the top of every hour. At the end of each hours the points you made are added to the general weekly challenge leaderboard that started during the last techtime of June.


## Why you should play

Some of us already play as part of work. The Thursday Board Games meeting is an example of that. 

Note that unlike previous challenges where the few lines of code you wrote were challenge specific and obsolete at the end of the challenge weeks, work you will put here, either as a player or somebody contributing to the game design or its code will last indefinitely :)
