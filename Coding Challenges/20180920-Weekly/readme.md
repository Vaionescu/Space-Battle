**Note**: Space battle is currently in active implementation stage. Launch is planned for **Thursday 20th September**. The documentation and specs are written and published to let you get familiar with the concepts, game mechanics and API ahead of time. 

- **01-Space-Battle.md**: High level description of the game.

- **02-Game-API.md**: Read this if you intend to play, it contains everything you need to drive your fleet, either manually from the command line or through a programmatic client (written in the language of your choice since the interface is just HTTP).

- **03-More-Game-Information.md**: More details about the game.
