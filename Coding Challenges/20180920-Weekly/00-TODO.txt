-> Needed before launch

[] Need to run UserFleet::spawnCapitalShipTopUpChallenge after a top up :)
[] When the map is created, move the game parameters to the timeline and read it from there
[] When a map is created create the BBC fleet.
[] Make sure that all the end points are in the game API
[] Implement /bomb/:battlecruisershipuuid/:targetpointlabel
[] Implement throttling
[] Test every end point (^_^)

-> Can be done after launch

[] Semaphore for all IO actions.

[] Define a convention to encode game actions
    [] Implement game action log (to be able to reply battles)
    [] Implement the BBC player (it should log itself up, for replay)
