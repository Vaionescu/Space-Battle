-> Needed before launch

[] Implement throttling
[] GameLibrary::ensureGameFolderSetUpForThisHour() is not yet setting the bbc
[] Test every end point (^_^)
[] Write 02-Start Playing.md
[] Write the server PID in a file
[] Modify all the end point answers with the entire fleet report

[] top up types (1 / 2) seems irrelevant. 
    You know what it is from the ship types.
    I see what you're saying, but they are not the same type of operation. In one case you supply a ship uuid and an amount and in the other you supply two ship uuids. Leave it to me  though. I will simplify it before tomorrow.

[] Release the server as a daemon.

[] Document damageCausedForAttacker in the Game API
        damageCausedForAttackerReport = {
            "nomenclature" => targetShip["nomenclature"],
            "alive" => targetShip["alive"]
        }

[] I am not doing this
BombReport
    {
        "shipsHit" : Array[BombReportShipDetail]
    }

    BombReportShipDetail
    {
        "username"     : USERNAME
        "nomenclature" : SHIP-NOMENCLATURE
        "destroyed"    : Boolean
    }

[] Do I take account of "bombsEffectMultiplier" ?

[] Am I generating this: WarningLogItem ?

[] Read proof the GAME-API

-> Can be done after launch

[] Enforce coding convention #2
[] Semaphore for all IO actions.
[] There is too much logic into the route file. 
[] Define a convention to encode game actions
    [] Implement game action log (to be able to reply battles)
    [] Implement the BBC player (it should log itself up, for replay)
