[] When the map is created, move the game parameters to the timeline and read it from there
[] When a map is created create the BBC fleet.
[] Make sure that all the end points are in the game API
[] Implement /bomb/:battlecruisershipuuid/:targetpointlabel

[] Semaphore for all IO actions.

[] Navigation::jumpEnergyCostShipType(sourceMapPoint, targetMapPoint, shipType)
