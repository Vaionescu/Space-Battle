-> Needed before launch

[] The game-parameters.json are looked for in two places.
    - The timeline and the source code. 
    - If found in the timeline, use that
    - If not use the source code one game-parameters.json
    - The creation of a map copies the file to the timeline.

-> Can be done after launch

[] Semaphore for all IO actions.

[] Navigation::jumpEnergyCostShipType(sourceMapPoint, targetMapPoint, shipType)
    Is currently not taking account of the ship type.

[] Define a convention to encode game actions
    [] Implement game action log (to be able to reply battles)
    [] Implement the BBC player (it should log itself up, for replay)
